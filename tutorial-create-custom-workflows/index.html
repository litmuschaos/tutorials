      <google-codelab-step label="Chaos Hub" duration="5">
        <h2 is-upgraded>What is Chaos Hub?</h2>
<p>Litmus Chaos Hubs allows you to connect to your Public Choas Hubs pulled directly from your Github repos. You can then customize the experiments, orchestrate workflows, and use them in the ChaosCenter as custom workflows.</p>
<p>Initially, there is one Chaos Hub present, the <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/" target="_blank">Litmus Chaos Hub</a>. This hub contains experiments from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/" target="_blank">https://hub.litmuschaos.io/</a>. You can use this default Hub or connect to a new external hub.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Connecting to a Chaos Hub on a public GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Navigate to the Chaos Hub tab on the ChaosCenter and click the Connect New Hub button.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/67bc63e5d26263d2.png"></p>
<p>Here, you will be presented with a form to add a Chaos Hub. You will need to provide a name, select public, and type in the URL of the Github repo you want to add and its corresponding branch.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/91b4ec97b1010ac.png"></p>
<p>Here we would be using a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts" target="_blank">Chaos Hub</a>, a public repo for this tutorial. You can find this fork <a href="https://github.com/Gbahdeyboh/chaos-charts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, give the Hub the name of MyHub, then type in the repo URL https://github.com/Gbahdeyboh/chaos-charts and the branch master. Then click the Submit button. You should have two hubs, MyHub and Chaos Hub.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7b0bd4f044a714db.png"></p>
<p>Click on the MyHub Hub and view the available charts it has.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/df8a4819325c5ffc.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Connecting to a Chaos Hub on a private Github repository</h2>
<p>Navigate to the Chaos Hub tab on the ChaosCenter and click the Connect New Hub button.</p>
<p>Provide a name, select private and type in the URL of the Github repo you want to add and the corresponding branch.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/a2e0fb4b1600002e.png"></p>
<p>Because this is a private repo, you have to give the ChaosCenter access to it. This can be done by using any of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access token.</li>
<li>SSH key.</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>Access token</h3>
<p>To add an access token, navigate to <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" target="_blank">github.com/settings/tokens</a> and click on the <strong>Generate new token</strong> button.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/6f28b3bc0b4ff07f.png"></p>
<p>Add a description to the note section of the token, then select scopes for the token. The scopes let GitHub know what permissions levels the token has, select the scopes you want but specifically give the token read access to your repositories and click on the Generate token button.</p>
<p>Make sure you copy your token once it is added. You won&#39;t be able to copy it afterwards and will need to generate a new one.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/9b34549af6f1b8e2.png"></p>
<p>Go back to the ChaosCenter and paste this token into the access token field, then click the <strong>Submit Now</strong> button.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>SSH key</h3>
<p>If you selected the SSH key option, you will be presented with an already generated SSH key, click the <strong>Copy</strong> button to copy this key and go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/ssh" target="_blank">github.com/settings/ssh</a> to add it to your account.</p>
<p>You will see a new SSH key button, click it, add a title and paste in your SSH key and click the Add SSH key button.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>submit now</strong> button.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/52577463d597efb9.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Exploring the Chaos Hub</h2>
<p>After adding a new hub, you can click on the hub name to explore the charts and workflows present in the hub.</p>
<p>In the default Chaos Hub, there is a pre-defined workflows section and a chaos charts section. The pre-defined workflows allow you to quickly set up a simple workflow and execute it.</p>
<p>You can now create custom workflows from experiments in the chaos charts!.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Creating a Custom Workflow" duration="0">
        <p>In this section, you will create custom workflows from the hub we connected to in the last section.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>1) Select a Target Agent</h2>
<p>First, navigate to the Workflows tab on the ChaosCenter and click the Schedule a workflow button. It will take you to the workflow page.</p>
<p>You need to select a Target Agent to proceed, these agents consist of CRDs and the required resources to run a chaos workflow. While installing the ChaosCenter, a default agent named Self Agent is created. Select the Self Agent.</p>
<p>Note: You may have to wait for the agent to be up and ready, after which you can move forward by again clicking on &#34;Next&#34;</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>2) Choose a Workflow</h2>
<p>Here, you will see four different options from which you can create a workflow. For this tutorial, we will only use the Create a new workflow using experiments from the MyHub option. Select this option.</p>
<p>Then select the Hub you want to connect to which is MyHub and choose an experiment.Select the podtato-head experiment that will inject a pod-delete fault into a sample microservice application. Click the Next button when done.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>3) Workflow Settings</h2>
<p>Here, you can change the name of the workflow and also provide a description of the workflow. This section also consists of information regarding the namespace where the workflow will be scheduled. Click next when done.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>4) Tune Workflow</h2>
<p>This section consists of all the information related to the chaos workflow. Some new and advanced features that are present in this section are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow Visualization: This feature allows you to visualize the workflow even before scheduling it. This gives brief information related to the structure of workflow i.e if the experiments are present in a serial or parallel way.</li>
<li>Workflow Table: This table contains the list of experiments present in the workflow. It also consists of some valuable information related to the target applications.</li>
<li>Edit Yaml: With this option, you can view and change the workflow manifest with a YAML editor.</li>
<li>Revert Chaos: For custom workflows, you can enable or disable the revert step from the ChaosCenter. With the revert step enabled, a new functionality called podGC is also added which deletes the workflow pods after the completion of workflow as part of the clean-up process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7e99334569ffd10.png"></p>
<p>Don&#39;t care too much about the above if you do not understand it yet. Click the <strong>Next</strong> Button to proceed.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>5) Reliability Score</h2>
<p>You can assign weights to the experiments present in the workflow. These weights will be then used for the calculation of the resilience score after the workflow completion. By default, 10 points are assigned to each experiment. This can be altered as per your use case. After selecting weights click on the <strong>Next</strong> Button.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>6) Schedule</h2>
<p>Workflows can be scheduled in two ways;</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule now: This option allows the workflow will start as soon as you schedule it.</li>
<li>Recurring Schedule: This option will allow you to schedule recurring workflows. It converts a normal workflow to Cron workflow by adding cron syntax in the workflow manifest. The following methods are available to schedule recurring workflows:</li>
<li>Every Hour</li>
<li>Every Day</li>
<li>Every Week</li>
<li>Every Month</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>7) Verify and Commit</h2>
<p>This is the final step in the workflow creation process. In this step, you can validate all the changes related to the workflow like the workflow name, the experiment weights, workflow description, workflow manifest, etc. Once you have verified all the changes, you can click the <strong>Finish</strong> button to start the schedule.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>8) Visualize and Analyze the workflow</h2>
<p>You can now Visualize your workflow by following steps 5 and 6 of the <a href="https://litmuschaos.github.io/tutorials/tutorial-getting-started/index.html#4" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> Tutorial.</p>
